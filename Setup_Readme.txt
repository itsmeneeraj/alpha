1. Install Visual Code studio (Or any IDE, but I am going to explain setup for VScode)
2. Install python latest version from Microsoft app store. (This is must. Even if you have python installed, VSCode will only refer to python installed from Microsoft app store)
3. install all dependencies like below 

pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install scipy

(install if it shows error for any missing library referring above syntax.)

How to execute. 

Sync the repository from Git (invite shared) or copy the code sent to you over mail and open the folder in VScode.
